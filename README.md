Redirectory for Social Services
===============================

The Redirectory is a simple solution for communities to build up a searchable service
for answering social services queries to their members with minimal overhead.

The ingredients consist of:
- A data import bridge to a simple format
- A CouchApp web application which consumes the output and structures it into a simple, easily replicated
database.
- A web application presenting a map and simple text search.
- A phone/SMS/IM service for querying the service via mobile phone or computer.
